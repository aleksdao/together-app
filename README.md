# together-app
Fullstack Academy Capstone project by John Hill, Alex Dao, and Joel Darling 

together is a suite of mobile and web apps for enhancing the live event and concert-going experience.

Artists create “Shows” that synchronize timeline-based events with crowd interactions.

Supported events include lighting up the screen in various colors, activating the phone’s flash and vibrate functionality, texting messages to all participants, selecting contest winners, and crowd-sourcing live event photos to create photo mosaics.

For a quick video highlighting all of the features in together, visit:

The various parts of the suite are organized into individual folders in this repo.
